  "bio_text_1": "The software field stands out due to the incredible people I've met and the amazing teams we've built. Our field encompasses many disciplines, and it's inspiring how we co-operate to achieve extraordinary outcomes. I thrive in collaborative environments, embracing teamwork to help businesses realize their software solutions using the latest web technologies. The challenge of technology and its potential to enable new possibilities draws me into this ever-expanding field. Whether building a solution, gaining deep knowledge on a subject, or increasing my proficiency, I am constantly learning. If you couldn't tell, I like to climb just about anything I can get my hands on. Naturally, if you don't see me at the office, I'm probably at the local bouldering gym. Hearing people talk about their passions fires me up. ",
