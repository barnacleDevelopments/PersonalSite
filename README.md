# Introduction

This repository is my personal portfolio site! I'm publicaly documenting the development process so that others can have a example project to build their own decentralized portfolio websites.

# Live Deployment

You can view the live deployed website at [devdeveloper.ca](https://devdeveloper.ca/). It is also hosted on [Fleek](https://app.fleek.xyz/) and can be accessed via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at [devdeveloper.eth](devdeveloper.eth).

Please note that while ENS is operational, it is still in the early stages of adoption, so accessibility may vary. For the best experience when using ENS, consider using a browser like Brave, which supports blockchain technologies and ENS natively. This means it can resolve ENS names directly without needing additional extensions or configurations.

Alternatively, you can access the site through a `.limo` extension, which provides a straightforward way to reach Ethereum-based domains by resolving them through a specific service designed for this purpose. This can be particularly useful if you're using a browser that doesnâ€™t natively support ENS.

# Setup

This repository contains two projects:

- Main GatsbyJs Project
- Smart Contract Project (developed with Hardhat)

## Smart Contract Project

The smart contract project is what runs the `/projects` page of my site.

The smart contract project uses Hardhat for development. Follow these steps to set up a local blockchain environment. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs).

All commands below should be run inside the `smart-contracts-hardhat` directory.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd smart-contracts-hardhat
npm install
```

### Start the Local Blockchain:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### Create Environment Variable File

Create `.env` file inside the smart-contracts-hardhat directory.

**Production Deployment Network Variables**

- MNEMONIC
- SEPOLIA_URL

**Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) Variables**

You can readmore about VRF on their [official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/vrf).

- VRF_KEY_HASH
- VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- VRF_COORDINATOR_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA

#### TODO: Setup CCIP local simulator

The CCIP local simular allows us to run Chainlink services locally for development purposes. This project utilizes Chainlink VRF to create verifiable randomness on the blockchain.

#### Deploy the Project Voting Smart Contract Locally Using Hardhat Ignition

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/ProjectVoting.ts --network localhost --reset
```

**Output:**

```bash
âœ” Confirm deploy to network localhost (1337)? â€¦ yes
âœ” Confirm reset of deployment "chain-1337" on chain 1337? â€¦ yes

Deployed Addresses:

ProjectVotingModule#ProjectVoting - 0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed
```

Take note of the smart contract address `0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed`.

#### Initialize and Apply Projects to the Blockchain:

Run the initialization script to add new projects to the local blockchain. You can then see these projects on the `/projects` page.

```bash

npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/create-projects.js
```

#### TODO: Test Scripts

There is a test script for the project voting smart contract and all should pass before proceeding.

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### TODO: The Graph Subgraph Integration

I plan on updating this project to utilize the [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) which is a blockchain indexer for efficient data querying. This project currently interacts directly with the RPC layer through the injected `ethereum provider` of the browser.

#### TODO: Arweave Integration

I plan on changing the content source of my project from local files stored on the repository to files stored on [Arweave](https://arweave.org/build) to futher decentralize my project.

##### Steps:

- Create a gatsby-source-arweave project

## GatsbyJS Project

GatsbyJs is a powerful static site generator. You can read more about it on their [offical documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs).

### Create `.env` file for development

The following variables are used to comunicate for with the project voting smart contract. On the `/projects` page. For the `GATSBY_PROJECT_VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable use the contract address from the smart contract deployment.

- GATSBY_PROJECT_VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed
- GATSBY_WEB3_HTTPS_URL="http://localhost:8545"
- GATSBY_WEB3_WS_URL="ws://localhost:8545"
- GATSBY_WEB3_NETWORK="Local"

### Install Gatsby Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Gatsby Project

```bash
npm run develop
```
