# Introduction

This repository is my personal portfolio site! I'm publicaly documenting the development process so that others can have a example project to build their own decentralized portfolio websites.

## Decentralized Feedback Framework: Gated Rewards for Feedback (WIP)

This website includes a decentralized element where users can utilize a smart contract designed to insentivice feedback. This smart contract is designed to help people recieve geniune feedback on "things" through offering tangible rewards for genuine interactions. Geniune feedback is a hard thing to incentivise because it's subjective and rewards can easily be abused. The solution to this is putting the feedback reciever in control. Everyone knows what it feels like to receive genuine feedback. When we know we have received genuine feedbackback we are much more likely to reward those who have given it. Paying people directly for feedback is not enough because this only results in the bare minimum for the reward. Rewards should be gated so that the receiver determines when they are satified with the feedback they have received. This is pricely what my smart contract aims to solve. The planned incentivised behaviors are the following.

1. `VOTING` is the most basic form of feedback where a vote demonstrates a shallow level interest.
2. `COMMENTING` is short form piece of feedback that provides a deeper level of interest.
3. `REVIEW` is a long form pieve of feedback that provides a deep level of interest.
4. `SPONSOR` is a long term investment from an individual and shows a exeptional level of interest. (Still thinking about this)

There are two roles that the contract determines:

1. `Feedback Receivers`
2. `Feedback Providers`

All of these behaviors can be made against a "thing" that the `Feedback Reciever` wants. The `Feedback Reciever` provides a potential balance that the `Feedback Providers` can potentially recieve. If `Feedback Providers` manage to provide feedback that is useful to the `Feedback Reciever` they may receive this reward. When the `Feedback Feciever` recieves a peice of feedback they are satified with they choose a selection of `Feedback Providers` to recieve a reward (up to 3). 80% of the reward is then devided amonst them and the other 20% is devided amonst the other feedback providers. If the feedback provider decides not to fufill their side of the bargon, by not choosing winners, the 3 primary winners will be randomly selected and the remaining 20% of rewards will be split amonst the others. This ensures that feedback providers are rewarded for their behavior regardless of the behavior of the `Feedback Reciever`. The `Feedback Receiver` can perform a withdraw of their prize balance with a 30% penalty if they have already received feedback which is distributed amounst those who have provided feedback. The `Feedback Receiver` can decide to provide `sponsored gas` which allows the first few `feedback providers` to provide feedback without paying gas fees. This kick starts the feedback process.

### Contract Demonstration

To demonstrate this contract I have implemented it into my portfolio website. Users can provide feedback on my projects. It's a simple demonstration but clearly shows how the contract works.

## Ideas

1. Voting on a project could later reward a user for their honest feedback. A complete history of project files are stored on Arweave to provide a transparent history of a project over time. Users can see how a project changes over time through adjutments made to the files.
2. Later I want to add a feature where if a project changes as a result of feedback it has recieved, the user who provided that feedback will be rewarded.

# Live Deployment

You can view the live deployed website at [devdeveloper.ca](https://devdeveloper.ca/). It is also hosted on [Fleek](https://app.fleek.xyz/) and can be accessed via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at [devdeveloper.eth](devdeveloper.eth).

Please note that while ENS is operational, it is still in the early stages of adoption, so accessibility may vary. For the best experience when using ENS, consider using a browser like Brave, which supports blockchain technologies and ENS natively. This means it can resolve ENS names directly without needing additional extensions or configurations.

Alternatively, you can access the site through a `.limo` extension, which provides a straightforward way to reach Ethereum-based domains by resolving them through a specific service designed for this purpose. This can be particularly useful if you're using a browser that doesnâ€™t natively support ENS.

# Setup

This repository contains two projects:

- Main GatsbyJs Project
- Smart Contract Project (developed with Hardhat)

## Smart Contract Project

The smart contract project is what runs the `/projects` page of my site.

The smart contract project uses Hardhat for development. Follow these steps to set up a local blockchain environment. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs).

All commands below should be run inside the `smart-contracts-hardhat` directory.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd smart-contracts-hardhat
npm install
```

### Start the Local Blockchain:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### Create Environment Variable File

Create `.env` file inside the smart-contracts-hardhat directory.

**Production Deployment Network Variables**
These variables are used to deploy the project voting smart contract to the blockchain. Both these variables are only required for production deploy. You should keep these private, especially the private key.

- `PRIVATE_KEY` Wallet private key for deploy
- `SEPOLIA_URL` RPC test node url for deploy
- `ETHERIUM_URL` RPC production node url for deploy
- `ARWEAVE_WALLET_ADDRESS` Arweave wallet address to retrieve project markdown files.
- `ARWEAVE_TAG_PROJECT_FILE_VERSION` Arweave tag to retrieve project files by version.

**Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) Variables**
These variables are public ids that are used to reference a VRF instance. These are required for choosing the winner when the prize pool reaches the threshold in the project voting smart contract.

You can readmore about VRF on their [official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/vrf).

- VRF_KEY_HASH
- VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- VRF_COORDINATOR_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA

#### TODO: Setup CCIP local simulator

The CCIP local simular allows us to run Chainlink services locally for development purposes. This project utilizes Chainlink VRF to create verifiable randomness on the blockchain.

#### Deploy the Project Voting Smart Contract Localy Using Hardhat Ignition

This command will use the hardhat ignition script to deploy a local version of the smart contract on the hardhat node. The script does the following tasks:

1. Deploys the smart contract.
2. Retrieves project transaction ids and data from Arweave. The script uses the Arweave wallet address environment variable to find the project files. Also, a project version tag is used to retrieve the correct file type (this is nessisary because I'm iterating on the markdown format to eventually move to using MDX).
3. Create a project on the smart contract for each Arweave project.

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/ProjectVoting.ts --network localhost --reset
```

**Output:**

```bash
âœ” Confirm deploy to network localhost (1337)? â€¦ yes
âœ” Confirm reset of deployment "chain-1337" on chain 1337? â€¦ yes

```

Take note of the smart contract address `0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed`.

#### Initialize and Apply Projects to the Blockchain:

Run the initialization script to add new projects to the local blockchain. You can then see these projects on the `/projects` page.

```bash

npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/create-projects.js
```

#### TODO: Test Scripts

There is a test script for the project voting smart contract and all should pass before proceeding.

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### TODO: The Graph Subgraph Integration

I plan on updating this project to utilize the [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) which is a blockchain indexer for efficient data querying. This project currently interacts directly with the RPC layer through the injected `ethereum provider` of the browser.

#### TODO: Arweave Integration

I plan on changing the content source of my project from local files stored on the repository to files stored on [Arweave](https://arweave.org/build) to futher decentralize my project. These assets will be pulled from arweave at build time to staticaly generate pages. This will make page load times fast and prevent needing to access arweave for every page load. A link to the original file will be provided on the static page for cross-reference.

_The point of storing the projects on Arweave is to have a permanent reference to their existence (immutibility). Each file stored on Arweave is writen in markdown and all images referenced within are links to image files also stored on Arweave. This is crutial to insure that there is always a reference to the file in a specific state to insure transparency in the voting process. This is a demonstration of how democratic voting would work on the blockchain using smart contracts and decentralized storage solutions._

##### Steps:

- Create a gatsby-source-arweave project

## GatsbyJS Project

GatsbyJs is a powerful static site generator. You can read more about it on their [offical documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs).

### Create `.env` file for development

The following variables are used to comunicate for with the project voting smart contract. On the `/projects` page. For the `GATSBY_PROJECT_VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable use the contract address from the smart contract deployment.

- GATSBY_PROJECT_VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed
- GATSBY_WEB3_HTTPS_URL="http://localhost:8545"
- GATSBY_WEB3_WS_URL="ws://localhost:8545"
- GATSBY_WEB3_NETWORK="Local"

### Install Gatsby Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Gatsby Project

```bash
npm run develop
```
