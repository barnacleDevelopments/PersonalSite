_This is part of a series of articles in the works on bringing movement into my life. In my own experience, I have seen movement bring a lot of positivity into my life and the lives of those I love. I believe everyone should seek movement no matter what form that takes for them. In my introductory acticle, I explain why is use the word movement and not fitness. Fitness I believe has become synonymous with a distorded mindset where we set unrealistic standard on ourselves. This has been amplified through media and I think it's time people begin to look inward to find their own form movement._

Having the right kit for the gym is a massive convenience. I believe everyone should refine and develop their kit to make your exercise routine as seemless as possible. No matter where your gym is their are ways to streamline things to make the most out of your day while still getting your exercise in. I don't believe this refinement process should be complicated nor should it be developed overnight. It is a slow process of adding and removing products to eventually have a system that works for you. I'll discuess what led me to my current setup as someone who climbs and does calestetics.

## My Setup

Before diving into the why, I wanted to outline my setup and what it is composed of.

- Aer Backback
- Small Soap Containers
- Carrbiner for shoes
- Sandles
- Chalk bag
- Stinky Laundrey Bag
- Microfibre Towl
- Owala Bottle
- Two pairs of climbing shoes
- Harness (Don't use this much)

Everyone has their own equipment and priorities depending on what type of movement they do and their commute.

- some people drive and go olympic lifting
- some people bus and go bodybuild
- some walk and go swim
- some run and go garden

before I wanted to write an article on my gym kit.

I have picked up a few different products and I've configured them into a convenient package to make my gym visits seemless.
