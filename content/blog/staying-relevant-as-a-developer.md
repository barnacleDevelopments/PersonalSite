There seems to be a serious misunderstanding and a doomer mindset surrounding the current job market for individuals in the IT sector. With headlines stating that LLMs are taking everyone’s jobs and news of massive layoffs across the industry, concerns are rising about the future of IT professionals. In this article, I aim to provide insight into the actual state of the job market and share tips on how developers can stay relevant in these changing times.

## Adapting as an IT Professional

First, it's essential to understand that being an IT professional requires a distinctive mindset. Unlike other professions, the IT industry demands adaptability. Worrying about LLMs reflects an inflexible mindset, similar to focusing too much on doomer headlines. People who succeed in this industry are those who dig deep to find solutions to problems.

If you are serious about being an IT professional, you need to apply this problem-solving mindset to your perspective on the industry. Most experienced IT professionals aren't overly concerned about LLMs because these models don't solve new problems—they regurgitate information. The real solutions of tomorrow will require professionals who can generate innovative ideas and collaborate with AI as a tool.

## The Job Market: By the Numbers

Let's start by addressing the doom-and-gloom with some hard statistics, specifically for Canada and the US.

Computer Engineers: The Government of Canada’s job bank website projects a labor shortage over the next 10 years, with 44,300 jobs and 48,800 job seekers expected by 2031 (as of 2023) source.

Web Developers: Similarly, there will be 10,400 new jobs for web developers between 2022 and 2031, with 12,700 job seekers.

While these statistics indicate a shortage of professionals, if you browse job boards, you'll find plenty of openings. The explanation is simple: employers are looking for skilled workers who know how to solve problems. For recent graduates with little experience, landing a job can be challenging without hands-on problem-solving skills. So how do you gain experience and stand out?

## Separating Yourself from the Crowd

A common argument is: “How am I supposed to gain experience if no one gives me a chance?” This mindset comes from a place of entitlement. In this industry, a diploma or degree alone isn’t enough. School often doesn't expose you to real-world problem-solving. In the real world, you need to prove you can solve problems—and that’s what employers are looking for. Some of the key skills that companies value include:

- Communication
- Problem-solving
- Time management and organization
- Openness to learning and adaptation
- Empathy
- Patience
- Interpersonal skills

These are skills that take time to develop, and some come more naturally than others. Before deciding to pursue a career in software development, it's essential to evaluate where you stand in these areas. If these skills don't resonate with you, it may be worth reconsidering if this field is right for you.

## Know Yourself Before Moving Forward

Before diving into or continuing your career, reflect on who you are and what you’re capable of becoming. This is a hard truth that many don't grasp. Everyone has unique strengths, and aligning those strengths with the right industry is crucial for success.

With this in mind, think back to the job market numbers mentioned earlier. A significant number of job seekers likely lack the critical skills I’ve outlined. I remember my time in college—many of my peers had a mindset of “just getting through.” Instead of focusing on growth, they saw college as the finish line. But the truth is, college is just the beginning of your career. Rather than celebrating the diploma, celebrate yourself and your ongoing growth.

## Learn to Love what you do and explore topics that interest you

Being a software developer is a really intersting and inspiring proffesion. Through pursuing it you gain the ability to use a set of tools to build some amazing things. There are so many different direction you can take a limiting yourself to a subset of the industry won't help keep you motivated and relevant for long.

A good example of this is sticking to Front-End developement and not exploring Back-End developerment. If you take the time to learn and understand both of these sectors, you become a more well rounded developer. Even if you specialize in one or the other, having a good understandnig of both can make you a better team player.

## Find your niche

Another thing that all developers should eventually do is find their Niche. This mean finding a way for you to standout from other developers. If you have a skillset that is different from the magority you become even more valueable.

## Have a Positive Attitude and Don't be Afraid to not Know something

Having a positve attitude is so important. If you have met anyone with a positve attiude they gleem with light. Those types of people are easy hires because they show motivation and exitement. If you are too serious or trying to br perfect you won't come accross as being genuine.

# Conclusion

The job market is evolving, but there's no need for panic. Staying relevant as a developer involves a growth mindset, a focus on problem-solving, and developing the right skills. By doing this, you'll be well-positioned for the opportunities that lie ahead./
