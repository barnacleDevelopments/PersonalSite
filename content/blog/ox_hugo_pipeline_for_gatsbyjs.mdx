## Description

I've been using Doom Emacs for the past year and I am really loving doing as much as possible within its environment. There is this awesome package called [ox-hugo](<https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/>) that allows users to convert \`.org\` files to markdown. This is a pretty useful feature if you like writing in [org-mode](<https://orgmode.org/>) and need to be able to export into a different format. This can be paired with the [Hugo framework](<https://gohugo.io/>) to create a seamless static site generating pipeline. Imagine opening a directory on your machine and writing an article in org and have that file automatically get converted into a web page. Pair that with the Hugo Framework and you have an awesome static site generator. If you are like me and love automation that's pretty darn cool!

My current website is written in Gatsby so you can image that when I found out about the [Hugo framework](<https://gohugo.io/>), I quickly wanted to re-write my whole site which is a bad impulse that many developers fall into (distro hoping comes to mind). Though that would be desirable because the Hugo framework is wicked, I'm not willing to re-write my whole site just yet. Though there is certainly the possibility of that happening in the future, when I don't have better more productive things to do, I still want the partial benefits of Hugo while maintaining my current site.

**GatsbyJS is a static site generator that was popular about 5 years ago but has since lost it's throne to more popular [Javascript frameworks like NextJS and Svwelt](<https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/39062>). I know GatsbyJS is no longer the cool kid but I don't plan on spending time converting it over to anything new unless Gatsby actually looses long term [support from Netlify](<https://devclass.com/2023/02/01/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-with-focus-on-plugin-ecosystem-and-valhalla-content-hub/>). The commits to Gatsby have been minimal so I'm concerned about its near term future.**

If you are familiar with Gatsby, you know that it's content sourcing is pretty awesome and flexible (though labour heavy at times through it's GraphQL layer). I currently use [mdx](<https://mdxjs.com/>) to statically source my websites content and while the standard mdx writing experience is good, it's not org and org is what I want ;). Another inconvenience is having to navigate to my project directory into the content folder and write a mdx file and push it up to my project repository.

Though that is not too much trouble, I'd rather work within the org environment where I have access to all my shortcuts and utilities. For example, to create a new article, all I need to do is type \`:leader n r n b\` and I have a article template ready to go. All I have to do is save and voila published!

Anyway, the Hugo Framework, being a static site generator itself, has it's own publishing flow and introducing Gatsby into the mix required me to design an adaptive layer to achieve a similar publishing flow with GatsbyJS. Thankfully, all I needed was a function from the ox-hugo package which let's me convert from org to mdx. This will be handy because I can begin to write my content the hugo way and migrate to it when I have the time. I ran into a few different issues along the way but I have a pretty seemless setup at this point that will do for now.


## What did I do?

Now that all the pre-amble is over, let's dig into how I achieved this. To start here is the snippet I wrote for handling the conversion from org =&gt; mdx =&gt; gatsby nodes.

```emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-to-md-on-save ()
  "Export Org file to Hugo-compatible Markdown cleanly, strip heading IDs, and copy it to the destination directory."
  (when (and (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
             (buffer-file-name)
             (string-prefix-p (expand-file-name "~/org-roam/posts/")
                              (expand-file-name (buffer-file-name))))
    ;; Don't show temporary export buffer
    (let ((org-export-show-temporary-export-buffer nil))
      (let* ((base-name (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)))
             (exported-md (org-hugo-export-as-md)))
        (when (buffer-live-p exported-md)
          (let* ((destination-dir (expand-file-name "~/WebDev/Projects/PersonalSite/content/blog/"))
                 (title (replace-regexp-in-string "[[:digit:]]\\{14\\}-" "" base-name))
                 (destination-file (expand-file-name (concat title ".mdx") destination-dir)))
            (with-current-buffer exported-md
              ;; ðŸ§¹ Strip before saving
              (save-excursion
                (goto-char (point-min))
                (while (re-search-forward "]+\\)}" nil t)
                  (replace-match "")))
              (write-region (point-min) (point-max) destination-file))
            (kill-buffer exported-md)))))))
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'my/org-to-md-on-save)
```


## Step by Step

The first and most important step is to use the org-hugo-export-as-md function to spawn a buffer containing the current org file converted to markdown.

```emacs-lisp
(let* ((base-name (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)))
        (exported-md (org-hugo-export-as-md)))
```

Next we take the contents of that buffer and write that to a mdx file inside my project content directory.

```emacs-lisp
(let* ((base-name (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)))
        (exported-md (org-hugo-export-as-md)))
(when (buffer-live-p exported-md)
    (let* ((destination-dir (expand-file-name "~/WebDev/Projects/PersonalSite/content/blog/"))
            (title (replace-regexp-in-string "[[:digit:]]\\{14\\}-" "" base-name))
            (destination-file (expand-file-name (concat title ".mdx") destination-dir)))
    (with-current-buffer exported-md
        ;; ðŸ§¹ Strip before saving
        (write-region (point-min) (point-max) destination-file))
    (kill-buffer exported-md))))
```

Just before we write the buffer contents we strip the header IDs because Gatsby does not know how to parse these and the build process will fail as a result.

```emacs-lisp
...
;; ðŸ§¹ Strip before saving
(save-excursion
(goto-char (point-min))
(while (re-search-forward "]+\\)}" nil t)
    (replace-match "")))
...
```

Voila! We have setup the conversion from org to mdx and Gatsby can successfully build it's pages.
