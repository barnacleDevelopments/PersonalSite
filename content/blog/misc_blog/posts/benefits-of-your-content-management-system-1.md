Content management systems (CMS) are a great addition to any website. In
short, they are a powerful and quick way of updating website content without
needing a developer and enable an easy content strategy. Today, we will cover
what benefits they bring and how you can advantage of them.

## What are its applications?  

With a CMS you can manage your websites content easily and quickly. A great use case would be for an E-Commerce website that sells baked goods. Traditionally, to add new baked goods to this website a developer would need to be hired. This is a time-consuming and expensive service. Obviously, there is a better solution.

The solution starts with a CMS that is adapted to a business's needs. For businesses like our bakery, a CMS would allow site owners to add new baked goods or any other product to their website without a developer. Now we are talking!

Another great case would be for a company that has regular announcements on their website. With a CMS, they would be able to add new announcements whenever they like and see them live shortly after.

## For whom is a CMS for? 

Not every business needs a CMS. Some business just wants a simple landing page to give them an online presence and do not have product or service listings. However, there are less obvious and beneficial use cases for CMSs. The most advantageous part of having a CMS is to enable a content strategy.

A content strategy is a vital part of any business website to increase its traffic. If you would like to learn more about them, I wrote an article on why you need a [Web Content Strategy](/blog/misc_blog/posts/web-content-strategies). In short, they increase your website's utility to customers by giving them a reason to visit your website. Without a content strategy, visitors have little reason to visit or return to your website. Trust me, this will pay in dividends through increasing conversion rates to your website.

## When should you implement a CMS? 

A CMS is certainly not required when you are first getting started. The primary objective is to have a basic web presence that you can build off going forward. Later when you have thought about how your business could benefit from a CMS, you can begin implementing one.

For instance, if a bakery begins bulk production and is ready to deliver products on a larger scale they can start adding new product listings to their site. In other cases, a blogger may need to set up a CMS to regularly post new articles to their website. In both cases, regular content updates can result in further website traffic and also increase your organic search results on search engines (Bekaert, n.d.).

Although, it's important to think ahead and pick your development platform wisely to ensure your website is capable of implementing a CMS that meets your specific business requirements. Unique you!

## What platform should I use?

Depending on what route you choose to create your website (custom or cloud service) you'll encounter different ways of setting up a CMS. Some may result in increased development time and cost, while others are quick and cheap.

The quick and cheap route is a cloud-based service like [Wix](https://www.wix.com/html5bing/hiker-create-wix?utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=MS_Wix_NEW%5Ewix_English-x&experiment_id=wix%5Ebe%5E79783360752420%5Ewix&msclkid=54351382aa8f1907e3a4722fa1e5c727&utm_medium=cpc) or [Square Space](<https://www.squarespace.com/website-design/?channel=pbr&subchannel=bing&campaign=pbr-dr-bing-ca-en-squarespace-core-e&subcampaign=(brand-core_squarespace_e)&&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=pbr&utm_campaign=pbr-dr-bing-ca-en-squarespace-core-e&utm_term=squarespace&gclid=114e81f9afab165c8218e054a425a4bb&gclsrc=3p.ds&msclkid=114e81f9afab165c8218e054a425a4bb&utm_content=brand-core&gclid=114e81f9afab165c8218e054a425a4bb&gclsrc=3p.ds>). These are great if you aren't particular about how you want your web presence to appear. For those who want to stand out, a custom solution is best. Further, a custom solution also opens opportunities for more advanced features in the future.
