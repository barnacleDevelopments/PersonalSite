The modern climate has made human movement rigid and inflexible. From how we sit to how we walk, we have "civilized" human movement. Civilized movements are the typical movement patterns that people in large parts of the world engage in. Think sitting at a desk or standing for extended periods of time. The human body was not designed to be in these positions for too long. As someone who works at his desk, I can attest to this rigidity and I can tell you my hip flexors hate me for it. So what are people to do? Well I think it starts with listening to our bodies and also experiencing movements you may have not tried. However, these movements must first be normalized so let's start with a history lesson and also begin to question societal norms. You'll come to understand that much of the solution lies in our childhood.


### How people move in other countries


### How people moved historically

Believe it or not but humans used to move in fundamentally different ways before the advent of padded shoes, concrete sidewalks, and ergonomic chairs. Our movements put us inside our bodies natural movement patterns. We could sleep on the hard ground and sit around a campfire with our legs crossed. These movements are obvious to children. If you watch them you'll noticed most can't stand still and will sit in awkward positions or begin climbing things naturally. As they get older they begin to imitate the elders and forget how they used to move.


### Sociatal Norms

Now imagine all the movements we just discussed being performed on a busy city street. How would it make you feel? Some might say em barest or weird. Well they are absolutely right. Unfortunately, if you perform these movements in a public setting as an adult you'll begin to noticed that people might look at you funny. I've started to do this myself just to see what kind of reactions I get. Typically, people will look at my for a second and than look away. If you can get over the fact that most people really don't care you'll begin to feel more comfortable doing these movements without fear of being outlasted.


### The Top Fundamental Human Movements


#### Movement to start with

-   Crossed leg sit
-   Straigt leg sit
