Open graph protocol (OGP) is a method of treating a web page as an object. This allows platforms like social media to be able to recognise web pages within them. For intance, imagine you have a blog post and you want to post it on Facebook to share with your network. If utilizing the OGP protocol on your blog post page, Facebook can appropriately display it as a regular Facebook post. This makes content more interoperable between platforms. In other words, it allows websites to better talk to each other.

I have implemented the OGP protocol on each of my webpages on this site to allows me to share my blog posts and projects to the different media platforms like Linkedin to have them display my content in an appealing way. You can learn more about OGP on their [website](https://ogp.me/).
