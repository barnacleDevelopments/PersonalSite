Do you ever ask yourself what the hell am I doing? This is a question that I often ask myself and I'm finally getting around to helping myself anwsering it. I've had this idea of creating a set of instructions for myself to follow each day to take back control of my mind. The name of these instructions is the Attention Framework. This framework touches topics but I wanted to distil it into an easily digestable format that would allow me to follow it strictly and know when I am begining to deviate from it. I've read my fare share of self-help books and watched countless YouTube videos and I feel it is time to stop day dreaming and actually solve this pressing question. This framework focuses on a few key areas that impact my life but I hope that it might help someone else who deals with similar problems.

## What behaviors are against my wellbeing?

- endless social media scrolling

## What behaviors are for my wellbeing?

## Framework concepts

### Mindful Activities

### Catching Attention

#### noticing when I'm tired

#### noticing when I'm energetic

#### noticing when I'm distracted

#### noticing when I'm impulsive

### Directing Attention

If you don't know what to do, don't do anything until you've thought about it.

- if you want to watched a show, have a pre-prepared list of shows you want to watch.
- if you want to read, have a pre-prepared list of books to read.
- if you want to use social media, have a pre-defined time to use it for.
- if you want to work or learn something, know when to stop.

### Priming Focus

- don't use phone in the morning
- allow myself 30min to get into focus without distraction. If I can't focus, I need to perform _mindfull activities_

### Energy Threshold for Activities

## Attention Positive Behaviours

- when texting only engage in a chat for a long period if people are responding continuously. Do not switch between chat's to engage in different conversations.
- when working, dedicate 30min - 40min sessions of focused work. During these period, keep notifications switched off.

## Responsible Media Use

There is a lot of good content on media apps but a lot of them have shifted to short form content which framents your attention and prevents retention (soure).

## On the Job Learning and Off the Job Learning

On the job learning is the learding you do for job specific tasks. Let's say you have an office job as a software engineer. There are specific tasks you need to complete and those require that you learn on the job as you go.

Off the job learning is learning about things you don't have time for at work. I believe this type of learning should be cateloged. What I mean by this is it should be prepared and not be fed to you through social media. These could be related to work but don't need to be. Let's say you work as softwarre engeneer but love fitness. When you are off the job you have a catelog that you pull from to learn.

### Creating a catelog

There are a few strategies that I have come up with for creating this catelog of learning. I believe this catelog should not be something like saving instagram posts or youtbue videos to a playlist. This catelog should be careful curated. I'd recommend opening a Word document or utsing a note taking application to currate content you want to consume. This not only makes an organized space for your learning but with the right mindset create a barrier between you and manipulative currated content like intagram and youtube. What I mean by this is before you approach consumption you direct your attention to your document instead of opening a media app. Like I said before it's ok to use media apps like this but be intentional about it. Set a timer for 30 minutes on instagram or less and when you come accross something that interestes you, move it to your document to look into further later.
