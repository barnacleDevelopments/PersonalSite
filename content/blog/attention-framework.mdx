Do you ever ask yourself what the hell am I doing? This is a question that I often ask myself and I'm finally getting around to helping myself anwsering it. I've had this idea of creating a set of instructions for myself to follow each day to take back control of my mind. The name of these instructions is the Attention Framework. This framework touches topics but I wanted to distil it into an easily digestable format that would allow me to follow it strictly and know when I am begining to deviate from it. I've read my fare share of self-help books and watched countless YouTube videos and I feel it is time to stop day dreaming and actually solve this pressing question. This framework focuses on a few key areas that impact my life but I hope that it might help someone else who deals with similar problems.

### Directing Attention

If you don't know what to do, don't do anything until you've thought about it.

- if you want to watched a show, have a pre-prepared list of shows you want to watch.
- if you want to read, have a pre-prepared list of books to read.
- if you want to use social media, have a pre-defined time to use it for.
- if you want to work or learn something, know when to stop.

### Priming Focus

- don't use phone in the morning
- allow myself 30min to get into focus without distraction. If I can't focus, I need to perform _mindfull activities_

### Energy Threshold for Activities

## Attention Positive Behaviours

- when texting only engage in a chat for a long period if people are responding continuously. Do not switch between chat's to engage in different conversations.
- when working, dedicate 30min - 40min sessions of focused work. During these period, keep notifications switched off.
