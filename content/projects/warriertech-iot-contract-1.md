description: "At WarrierTech, I played a key role in designing and developing APIs and front-end interface for an IoT-based project. This system collected and visualized real-time temperature and current data, enabling analysis through interactive graphs."
tech: "I was responsible for developing two APIs alongside a generic interface for consuming them and setting up the necessary infrastructure for secure deployment. To enhance scalability and performance, I implemented a dedicated Azure Function App for data ingestion and a separate one for data consumption. We chose CosmosDB to ensure seamless scalability as the dataset grew. For the front-end, I utilized HTMX with ExpressJS, enabling a server-rendered (SSR) approach that reduced complexity, improved performance, and minimized client-side security risks. This approach eliminated unnecessary client-side JavaScript while maintaining dynamic interactions through secure, server-controlled updates. Additionally, I integrated Azure B2C authentication to provide a secure and scalable user management system, allowing the client to create and manage users efficiently."
challenges: "This project was simple to develop and allowed me to learn about IoT hub and the HTMX library. The most challenging aspect was learning about Azure B2C and setting up the authentication FLOWS."
