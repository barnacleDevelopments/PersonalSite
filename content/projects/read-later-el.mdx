## Overview
read-later.el is an Emacs package that integrates Instapaper directly into the editor. It allows saving, organizing, and managing bookmarks without ever leaving Emacs. The package supports both the Instapaper Simple API and the Full API, providing everything from quick URL saving to folder management and highlights. This was my first Emacs package I have developed, and solved a painpoint I had where I wanted to be able to add new articles to instapaper on Emacs using Elfeed to later read on my Kobo e-reader.
