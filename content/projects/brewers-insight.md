title: Brewers Insight - Packaging BOM
description: Over the last year, I have actively participated in the development
  of Brewer's Insight (BI). BI gives brewers and owners insight into their
  operations by digitizing, streamlining and communicating their tasks and data
  points, so you and your team can spend less time on tedious administrative
  tasks and more time doing what you love; making great beer.

tech: Brewer's Insight is a browser application developed using Angular and
  ASP.NET Core.

challenges: The greatest challenges I have faced while working on BI has been
  the development of their latest feature Packaging Bill of Materials (BOM) and
  Finished Goods. As a full-stack developer, I worked on phasing out BI's
  previous packaging functionality into a more feature rich packaging BOM
  system. This feature allows brewers to organize packaging materials into sets
  speeding up the user's packaging routine. These are later turned into Finished
  Goods that can be consumed out of BI as finished products.
