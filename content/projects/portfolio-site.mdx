## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, share blog posts, and provide information about my professional experience. The site serves as a central hub for my online presence, featuring dynamic content management through MDX, automated reading list syncing from my Kobo e-reader, and a skills visualization based on real project experience.

<ProjectSection image={props.pageContext.frontmatter.image2} imageAlt={"Portfolio site projects page"} alignment="right">
## Tech
The site is built with Gatsby, a React-based static site generator that provides excellent performance and SEO out of the box. I use Theme UI for consistent styling and MDX for content that combines Markdown with React components. The site is deployed on Netlify with automatic builds triggered by git pushes.

## Features
Key features include a blog with category filtering, project showcases with technology tagging, an automatically calculated years of experience counter, a skills chart showing technology usage across projects, and a reading list that syncs from my Kobo e-reader. The site is fully open source and continuously evolving as I add new projects and content.
