tech: This site was built with Gatsby and is hosted via Netlify. It also uses
  Netlify's CMS to allow Nova to add new team members to her site without
  needing a developer.

challenges: This was my first site that I built using Gatsby. I had to learn how
  to implement various Gatsby plugins that would allow for quick image
  processing and markdown processing for files created on the Netlify CMS.
